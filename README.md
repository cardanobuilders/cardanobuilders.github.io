## What Is Hello Cardano?

Hello Cardano is the core course inside Cardano Builders. It walks you through 10 progressive lessons that start with the basics (creating a wallet, sending a transaction) and build toward complete blockchain applications. Each lesson focuses on one practical skill, and every lesson includes working code you can run yourself.

You finish the course with real projects on your GitHub profile and the ability to build, test, and deploy Cardano applications from scratch.

## Who Should Take This Course?

This course works for anyone with a basic understanding of programming. You do not need any blockchain experience. The lessons start from the fundamentals and introduce new concepts one at a time.

The course fits three groups especially well:

- **Complete beginners to blockchain:** The course assumes no prior blockchain knowledge and explains every concept as it appears.
- **Developers exploring Cardano:** If you build software in other ecosystems and want to learn Cardano, this gives you a structured path from first transaction to full application.
- **People with basic coding familiarity:** Some TypeScript knowledge helps you move faster, but the course focuses on Cardano concepts rather than language syntax.

## What Will You Learn?

The course covers 10 lessons. Each one teaches a specific skill and builds on the previous lesson.

| Lesson | What You Will Do |
|--------|-----------------|
| **1. Hello World** | Set up your tools, create a wallet, and send your first transaction |
| **2. Multi-Signature Transactions** | Build transactions that require multiple approvals and create tokens |
| **3. Smart Contracts with Aiken** | Write your first smart contracts using Aiken, a language designed for Cardano |
| **4. Testing Your Contracts** | Test smart contracts to verify they work correctly before deploying |
| **5. Efficient Contracts** | Reduce costs by optimizing how your contracts run on the blockchain |
| **6. Reading Blueprints** | Convert smart contract blueprints into working application code |
| **7. Vesting Contracts** | Build a contract that locks funds and releases them on a set schedule |
| **8. NFT Contracts** | Create a contract that mints unique digital assets (NFTs) |
| **9. Layer 2 with Hydra** | Use Hydra, Cardano's system for faster and cheaper transactions |
| **10. Web3 Services** | Add wallet services and sponsored transactions so users can start without setup |

## How Can You Earn the Hello Cardano Badge?

Complete three capstone projects to earn your Hello Cardano badge. Each project applies skills from the lessons and increases in difficulty.

2. **Peer-to-Peer Escrow:** Create a marketplace with secure, automated payments between buyers and sellers
3. **Full-Stack Sponsored dApp:** Build a complete application that covers onboarding, transactions, and user experience

You submit each project as a public GitHub repository with working code and a live transaction on the Cardano test network.
