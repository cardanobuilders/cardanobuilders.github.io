# Online Workshop #1

### May 28, 2025
Attendees: 24

This was the first workshop on the second milestone of our funded proposal at Cardano Project Catalyst Fund13 which enables us to provide online meetups and materials to support builders in the Cardano ecosystem.

This Workshop was hosted with our friends at Blazar Labs joined by Jingles, the founder of Mesh, introducing MeshJS and the Mesh SDK to newcomers as well as experienced builders in the Cardano Ecosystem.
We introduced MeshJS and our open source tools which help developers in their builder journey on Cardano. From a high level overview (presenting general architecture) to specific details with an open Q&A at the end of the session to respond to questions from the audience.
