# Online Workshop #2

### May 28, 2025
Attendees: 35

This was the second workshop on the second milestone of our funded proposal at Cardano Project Catalyst Fund13 which enables us to provide online meetups and materials to support builders in the Cardano ecosystem.

Hosted with our friends at Cardano India. Introducing MeshJS and the Mesh SDK to newcomers as well as experienced builders in the Cardano Ecosystem.
We discussed the development of the Mesh SDK, an open-source library for TypeScript. We highlighted its features, such as being production-ready, feature-complete, and mainnet-ready. We also explained the two flavors of the SDK: pure TypeScript and WebAssembly. The SDK is designed to be easy to use and has a comprehensive documentation system with live demos. We demonstrated how to get started with the SDK, including how to generate a wallet and build transactions. I also discussed the concept of change addresses and how to handle multiple assets and addresses in transactions. We then introduced the Web3 SDK, a tool for onboarding users and businesses to Web3. We demonstrated how it works, emphasizing its self-custody and security features. We also mentioned the roadmap for the SDK, including transaction sponsorship and integration with Free Tokens. Finally, We addressed some questions about the SDK and its use cases.
