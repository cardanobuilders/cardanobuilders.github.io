# Lesson #02: Multi-signature Transactions

A multi-signature (multi-sig) transaction requires more than one user to sign a transaction prior to the transaction being broadcast on a blockchain. You can think of it like a husband and wife savings account, where both signatures are required to spend the funds, preventing one spouse from spending the money without the approval of the other. For a multi-sig transaction, you can include 2 or more required signers, these signers can be wallets or script.

In this lesson, we will learn to build multi-signature transactions to mint a token. We will also setup a NextJS app to build a simple web interface to interact with the Cardano blockchain.

## System setup

### Download CIP30 wallet extension

In order to interact with the blockchain, we need a wallet extension. You can use any wallet that supports the CIP30 standard, which you can choose one to download [here](https://developers.cardano.org/showcase/?tags=wallet).

After downloading the wallet, you can restore the wallet using the seed phrase you created in the previous lesson.

### Setup NextJS and Mesh

Open the **Terminal** and execute this command to create a new NextJs application:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript mesh-multisig
```

```bash
Need to install the following packages:
Ok to proceed? (y)

✔ Would you like to use ESLint? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? … Yes
✔ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use App Router? … No
✔ Would you like to use Turbopack for next dev? … No
✔ Would you like to customize the import alias (@/* by default)? … No
```

Change directory (`cd mesh-multisig`) to the newly created folder and install the latest version of Mesh with npm:

```bash
npm install @meshsdk/core @meshsdk/react
```

### Add MeshProvider

In order to use Mesh React, we need to wrap our application with the `MeshProvider` component. Open the `src/app/layout.tsx` file and add the following code:

```ts
import "@/styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import "@meshsdk/react/styles.css";
import { MeshProvider } from "@meshsdk/react";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <MeshProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </MeshProvider>
  );
}
```

### Add CardanoWallet component

We can add a wallet React component to the application. This component will allow us to connect to the wallet and interact with the Cardano blockchain.

Open the `src/pages/index.tsx` file, you can delete the existing code and replace it with the following code:

```ts
import { CardanoWallet, useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { wallet, connected } = useWallet();
  return (
    <div>
      <CardanoWallet isDark={true} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view your application. **CTRL+C** to stop the application.

You should see a connect wallet component, which will allow you to connect to the wallet. Try connecting to your wallet.

## Minting script

In this section, we will create a minting script that will mint a token using a multi-signature transaction.

### Define the minting script

First, lets define a few constants that we will use in the minting script.

```ts
// Set up the blockchain provider with your key
const provider = new BlockfrostProvider("YOUR_KEY_HERE");

const demoAssetMetadata = {
  name: "Mesh Token",
  image: "ipfs://QmRzicpReutwCkM6aotuKjErFCUD213DpwPq6ByuzMJaua",
  mediaType: "image/jpg",
  description: "This NFT was minted by Mesh (https://meshjs.dev/).",
};

const mintingWallet = ["your", "mnemonic", "...", "here"];
```

- You will need to replace with your API key, replace `YOUR_KEY_HERE`
- You can define the asset metadata `demoAssetMetadata`
- You can generate a new mnemonic and use it for your minting script `mintingWallet`

### Create minting application wallet

Next, lets create a new function that will create a minting transaction. This function will take the asset metadata and the minting

```ts
async function buildMintTx(inputs: UTxO[], changeAddress: string) {
  // minting wallet
  const wallet = new MeshWallet({
    networkId: 0,
    key: {
      type: "mnemonic",
      words: mintingWallet,
    },
  });

  const { pubKeyHash: keyHash } = deserializeAddress(
    await wallet.getChangeAddress()
  );
}
```

- this function takes the inputs as a parameter, this inputs will be fed from your wallet to pay for minting fees
- initializes the application wallet with the mnemonic
- derive the pubkeyhash of the wallet, which will be used to create the minting script

### Create native script

Then, lets create the native script that will be used to mint the token.

```ts
// create minting script
const nativeScript: NativeScript = {
  type: "all",
  scripts: [
    {
      type: "before",
      slot: "99999999",
    },
    {
      type: "sig",
      keyHash: keyHash,
    },
  ],
};
const forgingScript = ForgeScript.fromNativeScript(nativeScript);
```

- `nativeScript` define the parameters of the script
- `ForgeScript.fromNativeScript` create the forging script

### Define asset metadata

Next, we define the asset metadata.

```ts
const policyId = resolveScriptHash(forgingScript);
const tokenName = "MeshToken";
const tokenNameHex = stringToHex(tokenName);
const metadata = { [policyId]: { [tokenName]: { ...demoAssetMetadata } } };
```

- `policyId` is the policy ID of the minting script, we derive it from the forging script using `resolveScriptHash`
- `tokenName` is the name of the token, you can change it to whatever you want
- `metadata` is the asset metadata, we can use the `demoAssetMetadata` defined above

### Create transaction

Finally, we are ready to build the minting transaction.

```ts
const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({
  fetcher: provider,
  verbose: true,
});

const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
  .mint("1", policyId, tokenNameHex)
  .mintingScript(forgingScript)
  .metadataValue(721, metadata)
  .changeAddress(changeAddress)
  .invalidHereafter(99999999)
  .selectUtxosFrom(inputs)
  .complete();
```

- `MeshTxBuilder` is the transaction builder that will be used to build the minting transaction
- `mint` takes the amount, policy ID and token name as parameters. Note that the token name is in hex format.
- `mintingScript` add the minting script to the transaction
- `metadataValue` add the asset metadata to the transaction, and `721` is the standard for the asset metadata
- `changeAddress` add the change address to the transaction, this is the address that will receive the change after the transaction is completed
- `invalidHereafter` add the invalid hereafter to the transaction, this is the slot number that the transaction will be invalid after
- `selectUtxosFrom` select the UTxOs from the inputs, this is the UTxOs that will be used to pay for the minting fees
- `complete` will complete the transaction and return the unsigned transaction

### Sign the transaction (application wallet)

Because this is a multi-signature transaction, we need to sign the transaction with the minting wallet. We can do this by calling the `signTx` function on the wallet.

```ts
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
```

### Source code

Here is the complete code for building the minting transaction:

```ts
async function buildMintTx(inputs: UTxO[], changeAddress: string) {
  // minting wallet
  const wallet = new MeshWallet({
    networkId: 0,
    key: {
      type: "mnemonic",
      words: mintingWallet,
    },
  });

  const { pubKeyHash: keyHash } = deserializeAddress(
    await wallet.getChangeAddress()
  );

  // create minting script
  const nativeScript: NativeScript = {
    type: "all",
    scripts: [
      {
        type: "before",
        slot: "99999999",
      },
      {
        type: "sig",
        keyHash: keyHash,
      },
    ],
  };
  const forgingScript = ForgeScript.fromNativeScript(nativeScript);

  // create metadata
  const policyId = resolveScriptHash(forgingScript);
  const tokenName = "MeshToken";
  const tokenNameHex = stringToHex(tokenName);
  const metadata = { [policyId]: { [tokenName]: { ...demoAssetMetadata } } };

  // create transaction
  const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({
    fetcher: provider,
    verbose: true,
  });

  const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
    .mint("1", policyId, tokenNameHex)
    .mintingScript(forgingScript)
    .metadataValue(721, metadata)
    .changeAddress(changeAddress)
    .invalidHereafter(99999999)
    .selectUtxosFrom(inputs)
    .complete();

  const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
  return signedTx;
}
```

## Execute the transaction

Now that we have the minting transaction, we can execute it.

```ts
async function mint() {
  if (connected) {
    const inputs = await wallet.getUtxos();
    const changeAddress = await wallet.getChangeAddress();

    const tx = await buildMintTx(inputs, changeAddress);
    const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(tx);

    const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
    console.log("Transaction hash:", txHash);
  }
}
```

- first we check if the wallet is connected
- then we get the UTxOs from the wallet, this is the UTxOs that will be used to pay for the minting fees
- then we get the change address from the wallet
- then we call the `buildMintTx` function to build the minting transaction
- then we call the `signTx` function to sign the transaction
- finally we call the `submitTx` function to submit the transaction to the blockchain

## Source code

The source code for this lesson is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cardanobuilders/cardanobuilders.github.io/tree/main/codes/course-hello-cardano/02-multisig).

## Challenge

Create a multi-signature wallet that requires 2 out of 3 signers to approve a transaction. Create a transaction to spend from that multi-sig wallet and sign it with the 2 signers. Submit the transaction to the blockchain and verify that the transaction was successful.
