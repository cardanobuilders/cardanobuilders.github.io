# Lesson #05: Avoid Redundant Validation

Do you have a question about the previous lessons - why have we performed even minting and state update in spending validators with withdrawal script? We know that every time we spend a UTxO from a spending validator would trigger checks, why can't I validate the counter update in the spending validator directly?

- illustrate complex tx with diagram
- show number of checks happens
- show revised version with less checks
- show withdraw 0 tricks as cleanest way to go
