# Lesson #03: Aiken Contracts

In the lesson 3 to lesson 6, we will touch of the core concepts of build Aiken smart contracts. Some of the materials are abstracted from [Andamio's AikenPBL](https://app.andamio.io/course/db22e013578fcead6c2fed5446d61891ad31f3cb4955e88d980107e7).

A Brief ideas of the lessons in this course vs AikenPBL:
- `Hello Cardano Course` (here) - explain some selected vital concepts of Aiken smart contracts development.
- `AikenPBL` - a complete end-to-end project-based learning course that covers all the essential and basic concepts.

As Aiken smart contract development is a professional, it is difficult to cover all the concepts in a single course. Therefore, we recommend you to go through both courses if you want to dive deep and start the career of a Cardano onchain developer.

## System setup

Before we begin, lets prepare our system for development. We will be using Aiken for this course, so make sure you have them installed on your machine. You can follow either of the following guides to set up your system:
1. [Aiken official installation guide](https://aiken-lang.org/installation-instructions)
2. [Andamio's AikenPBL setup guide](https://app.andamio.io/course/db22e013578fcead6c2fed5446d61891ad31f3cb4955e88d980107e7/101/lesson/1)

### Install cardano-bar



### Setup Empty Aiken Project

`npx meshjs project-name`

## Type of scripts

[Aiken documentation](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/cardano/script_context.html#ScriptContext) has a good explanation of the types of scripts in Cardano and that can be written in Aiken. Here is a brief overview:

For application, we will mostly using `Minting`, `Spending` and `Withdrawing` scripts, which are to be covered below.
