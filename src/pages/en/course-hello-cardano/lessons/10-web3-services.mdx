# Lesson #10: Web3 Services to Onboard Seamlessly

## Wallet as a Service

wallet-as-a-service (WaaS) solution provide a seamless way for users to transact on-chain. Developers can integrate social logins and other familiar experiences into their applications, making onboarding fast and effortless. Users can create non-custodial wallets (the user owns the key and have full control over their digital assets) instantly without needing to manage private keys. Users can also recover their wallets and export their private keys at any time.

Wallet key management system uses Shamir's Secret Sharing to split the private key into multiple parts. The parts are stored in different locations, such as the user's device and encrypted in the server. Neither UTXOS nor the developer's application has access to the user's keys. The private key is reconstructed only on the user's device during transaction signing, in an isolated iframe, which persists in-memory and is destroyed after the transaction is signed.

Overall, the integration with a wallet-as-a-service solution provides a self-custody wallet to end users and accelerates the time-to-market for developers.

## Transaction Sponsorship

Network fees are the costs required to execute transactions, compensating network validators for processing and securing the blockchain. These fees are paid in the networkâ€™s native token, such as ADA on Cardano. While essential for incentivizing validators and maintaining network security, network fees can pose a challenge for end users, as they must hold tokens to cover these costs when interacting with applications.

Sponsorship enables developers to create seamless user experiences by eliminating the need for end-users to hold tokens in their wallets for transactions. Instead, transactions inputs and network fees are deducted from the developer's wallet, solving one of the most significant challenges in blockchain application development and enabling frictionless onboarding and interaction for end-users.
