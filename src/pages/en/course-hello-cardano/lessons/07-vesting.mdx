# Lesson #07: Vesting Contract

A vesting contract locks funds for a specified period and allows only the designated beneficiary to withdraw them after the lockup expires. This lesson covers implementing and interacting with a vesting contract on Cardano using Aiken and the Mesh SDK.

## Overview

### What Is a Vesting Contract?
A vesting contract locks funds and releases them to a beneficiary only after a specified time period. It provides security and control over fund distribution.

### Key Features:
- **Lockup Period**: Funds are locked until a specific timestamp.
- **Owner and Beneficiary**: The owner deposits funds, and the beneficiary withdraws them after the lockup period.

## Smart Contract Details

### Datum Definition
The datum configures the vesting contract with three parameters:

- **`lock_until`**: POSIX timestamp until which funds are locked
- **`owner`**: Credentials of the fund owner
- **`beneficiary`**: Credentials of the beneficiary

```
pub type VestingDatum {
  /// POSIX time in milliseconds, e.g. 1672843961000
  lock_until: Int,
  /// Owner's credentials
  owner: ByteArray,
  /// Beneficiary's credentials
  beneficiary: ByteArray,
}
```

This datum can be found in `aiken-vesting/aiken-workspace/lib/vesting/types.ak`.

Next, we define the spend validator.

```
validator vesting {
  spend(
    datum_opt: Option<VestingDatum>,
    _redeemer: Data,
    _input: OutputReference,
    tx: Transaction,
  ) {
    // In principle, scripts can be used for different purpose (e.g. minting
    // assets). Here we make sure it's only used when 'spending' from a eUTxO
    expect Some(datum) = datum_opt
    or {
      key_signed(tx.extra_signatories, datum.owner),
      and {
        key_signed(tx.extra_signatories, datum.beneficiary),
        valid_after(tx.validity_range, datum.lock_until),
      },
    }
  }

  else(_) {
    fail
  }
}
```

The `vesting` validator allows withdrawal under two conditions:

1. The transaction is signed by the **owner** (can withdraw anytime), OR
2. The transaction is signed by the **beneficiary** AND the current time is past the lockup period

### How it works

The owner deposits funds into the vesting contract, locking them until the lockup period expires.

Cardano transactions include validity intervals that specify when a transaction is valid. The ledger verifies these bounds before executing any script. This gives scripts a sense of time while maintaining determinism: if a transaction has a lower bound `A`, the current time is at least `A`.

Since the upper bound is not controlled, a transaction could execute well after the vesting delay. From the script's perspective, this is acceptable; the contract only enforces a minimum wait time.

### Testing

A comprehensive test script is provided. Run tests with `aiken check`.

The test script includes the following test cases:

- success unlocking
- success unlocking with only owner signature
- success unlocking with beneficiary signature and time passed
- fail unlocking with only beneficiary signature
- fail unlocking with only time passed

See the full test source in [`vesting.ak`](https://github.com/cardanobuilders/cardanobuilders.github.io/blob/main/codes/course-hello-cardano/03-vesting/src/aiken-workspace/validators/vesting.ak).

### Compile and build script

To compile the script, run the following command:

```sh
aiken build
```

This command will generate a CIP-0057 Plutus blueprint, which you can find in [`plutus.json`](https://github.com/cardanobuilders/cardanobuilders.github.io/blob/main/codes/course-hello-cardano/03-vesting/src/aiken-workspace/plutus.json).

## Deposit funds

The owner deposits funds into the vesting contract and specifies the lockup period.

```ts
const assets: Asset[] = [
  {
    unit: "lovelace",
    quantity: "10000000",
  },
];

const lockUntilTimeStamp = new Date();
lockUntilTimeStamp.setMinutes(lockUntilTimeStamp.getMinutes() + 1);
```

This deposits 10 ADA into the vesting contract with a 1-minute lockup period.

```ts
// app wallet
const wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0,
  key: {
    type: "mnemonic",
    words: appWallet,
  },
  fetcher: provider,
  submitter: provider,
});

const utxos = await wallet.getUtxos();
const changeAddress = await wallet.getChangeAddress();

const { pubKeyHash: ownerPubKeyHash } = deserializeAddress(changeAddress);
const { pubKeyHash: beneficiaryPubKeyHash } =
  deserializeAddress(beneficiaryAddress);
```

This tutorial uses a separate app wallet to fund the deposit. Both the owner's and beneficiary's public key hashes are extracted using `deserializeAddress`.

```ts
const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({
  fetcher: provider,
  verbose: true,
});

const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
  .txOut(script.address, amount)
  .txOutInlineDatumValue(
    mConStr0([lockUntilTimeStampMs, ownerPubKeyHash, beneficiaryPubKeyHash])
  )
  .changeAddress(changeAddress)
  .selectUtxosFrom(utxos)
  .complete();
```

The transaction sends funds to the vesting contract's script address with an inline datum containing the lockup period, owner, and beneficiary.

Sign and submit:

```ts
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

Save the returned transaction hash; you will need it to withdraw the funds.

Example of a [successful deposit transaction](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/transaction/556f2bfcd447e146509996343178c046b1b9ad4ac091a7a32f85ae206345e925).

## Withdraw funds

After the lockup period expires, the beneficiary (or owner) can withdraw the funds.

First, fetch the UTXOs containing the locked funds:

```ts
const txHashFromDesposit =
  "556f2bfcd447e146509996343178c046b1b9ad4ac091a7a32f85ae206345e925";
const utxos = await provider.fetchUTxOs(txHash);
const vestingUtxo = utxos[0];
```

This fetches UTXOs from the deposit transaction. Next, prepare the datum and calculate the slot number for the transaction validity interval:

```ts
const datum = deserializeDatum<VestingDatum>(vestingUtxo.output.plutusData!);

const invalidBefore =
  unixTimeToEnclosingSlot(
    Math.min(datum.fields[0].int as number, Date.now() - 15000),
    SLOT_CONFIG_NETWORK.preprod
  ) + 1;
```

The lockup period from the datum determines the `invalidBefore` slot, ensuring the transaction is only valid after the lockup expires.

Construct the withdrawal transaction:

```ts
const txBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({
  fetcher: provider,
  verbose: true,
});

const unsignedTx = await txBuilder
  .spendingPlutusScript("V3")
  .txIn(
    vestingUtxo.input.txHash,
    vestingUtxo.input.outputIndex,
    vestingUtxo.output.amount,
    script.address
  )
  .spendingReferenceTxInInlineDatumPresent()
  .spendingReferenceTxInRedeemerValue("")
  .txInScript(script.cbor)
  .txOut(walletAddress, [])
  .txInCollateral(
    collateralInput.txHash,
    collateralInput.outputIndex,
    collateralOutput.amount,
    collateralOutput.address
  )
  .invalidBefore(invalidBefore)
  .requiredSignerHash(pubKeyHash)
  .changeAddress(walletAddress)
  .selectUtxosFrom(inputUtxos)
  .complete();
```

The transaction spends the locked UTXO from the vesting contract, specifying the script, datum, redeemer, collateral, validity interval, and required signer.

Sign and submit:

## Source code

The source code for this lesson is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cardanobuilders/cardanobuilders.github.io/tree/main/codes/course-hello-cardano/07-vesting).

## Challenge

Modify the vesting contract to implement a gradual vesting schedule where funds release over time instead of all at once. Alternatively, add a cliff period where the beneficiary must wait before any tokens become available.
