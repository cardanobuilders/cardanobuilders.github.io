# Introduction

## Purpose and Aim

Cardano Builders is a structured learning platform that takes developers from zero to one in Cardano development. The program covers on-chain smart contracts with Aiken and off-chain application development with the Mesh SDK through hands-on, project-based lessons.

Our mission:

- Provide a **unified learning resource** for building on Cardano
- Build a **collaborative community** of Cardano developers
- Create a **platform to learn, share knowledge, and collaborate** on real-world projects

By completing this program, you will gain practical skills in both **on-chain and off-chain development** using the latest tools and best practices in the Cardano ecosystem.

## Who Is This For?

This program is designed for:

- **Developers interested in Cardano**: New to blockchain or experienced, this program covers everything you need to start building.
- **Beginners with no blockchain experience**: No prior blockchain knowledge required. The course starts with fundamentals and progressively introduces advanced concepts.
- **Developers with basic TypeScript knowledge**: While blockchain experience is not required, familiarity with TypeScript will help you move faster through the material.

The structured approach ensures that anyone, regardless of background, can learn and apply Cardano development skills effectively.

## What Does the Learning Plan Cover?

The program consists of **10 structured sessions** covering essential aspects of Cardano development. All sessions are available in multiple languages, starting with **English and Vietnamese**.

### What You'll Learn

- **On-chain development with Aiken**: Write smart contracts using Aiken, a language designed for building efficient Cardano validators.
- **Off-chain development with Mesh**: Interact with the Cardano blockchain using the Mesh SDK to develop and deploy applications.
- **Common utilities and best practices**: Gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques widely used across the Cardano ecosystem.

### How You'll Learn

- **Online meetups**: Live sessions that keep learning flexible and interactive.
- **Hands-on workshops**: In-person coding sessions, discussions, and networking events for collaborative learning.
- **Mentorship program**: Experienced developers paired with newcomers to provide guidance throughout the learning journey.
- **Work opportunities**: Pathways to connect with teams and projects actively hiring Cardano developers.

By the end of the program, you will have the skills and confidence to **build, deploy, and contribute** to the Cardano ecosystem.
