# Introduction

## Purpose and Aim

Welcome to our Cardano Developer Learning Hub, a dedicated platform designed to take developers from zero to one in Cardano development. If you're just starting or looking to deepen your expertise, our initiative provides a structured, accessible, and community-driven learning experience.

Our mission is to:

- Offer a **unified learning resource** for developers who want to build on Cardano.
- Foster a **strong and collaborative community** of Cardano developers.
- Create a **platform for developers** to learn, share knowledge, and collaborate on real-world projects.

By joining this initiative, developers will gain practical skills in both **on-chain and off-chain development**, leveraging the latest tools and best practices in the Cardano ecosystem.

## Who is This For?

This learning program is designed for:

- **Developers interested in Cardano** - Whether you're new to blockchain or already have development experience, this program will help you get started.
- **Beginners with no prior blockchain experience** - You don't need to be an expert in blockchain to join. We will guide you through the fundamentals and progressively introduce more advanced concepts.
- **Developers with basic TypeScript knowledge** - While prior blockchain experience is not required, a basic understanding of TypeScript is recommended to help you get up to speed faster.

Our structured approach ensures that anyone, regardless of background, can learn and apply Cardano development skills effectively.

## Overview of the Learning Plan

Our program consists of **10 structured sessions**, covering essential aspects of Cardano development. These sessions are designed to be **accessible to everyone** and will be available in multiple languages, starting with **English and Vietnamese**.

### What You'll Learn:

- **On-chain development with Aiken** - Learn how to write smart contracts using Aiken, a powerful language designed for building efficient Cardano applications.
- **Off-chain development with Mesh** - Understand how to interact with Cardano's blockchain using Mesh, making it easier to develop and deploy applications.
- **Common utilities and best practices** - Get hands-on experience with tools and techniques that are widely used in Cardano development.

### How You'll Learn:

- **Online meetups** - Some sessions will be conducted through live online meetings, making learning flexible and interactive.
- **Offline hands-on workshops** - For deeper learning, we will organize in-person coding sessions, discussions, and networking events where developers can collaborate and share knowledge.
- **Mentorship program** - We believe in learning together. Our mentorship program will pair experienced developers with newcomers to provide guidance and support throughout the learning journey.
- **Work opportunities** - For those looking to work on real-world Cardano projects, we will provide pathways to connect with teams and projects actively hiring developers.

By the end of the program, participants will have the skills and confidence to **build, deploy, and contribute** to the growing Cardano ecosystem.
