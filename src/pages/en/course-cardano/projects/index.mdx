# Projects

Complete all three projects below to earn your **Hello Cardano** course badge. Each project builds on skills from the course lessons, progressing from intermediate to advanced.

<Callout type="info" emoji="📋">
  **Submission:** For each project, push your code to a public GitHub repository and submit the repo link along with preprod transaction hashes demonstrating your working implementation.
</Callout>

## Overview

| # | Project | Difficulty | Lessons |
|---|---------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | [Token-Gated Voting](/en/course-cardano/projects/01-token-gated-voting) | Intermediate | 1–6 |
| 2 | [Peer-to-Peer Escrow](/en/course-cardano/projects/02-escrow-marketplace) | Advanced | 1–8 |

## Submission Guide

To earn your **Hello Cardano** badge, submit all three projects:

1. **GitHub Repository**: Push each project to a public GitHub repository (one repo per project or a monorepo with separate directories). Each project must include:
   - A `README.md` with setup instructions
   - All Aiken source code and the compiled blueprint
   - All TypeScript off-chain code
   - Test results (screenshot or CI output from `aiken check`)

2. **Preprod Transaction Hashes**: For each project, provide at least one preprod transaction hash demonstrating your working implementation. Link to [preprod.cardanoscan.io](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io) so reviewers can verify on-chain.

3. **Submit**: Send your repository links and transaction hashes to the course team for review.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  All smart contracts must be deployed to the **Cardano preprod testnet**. Do not use mainnet for course submissions.
